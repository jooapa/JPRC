# ATRC C#

ATRC C# wrapper

## Using the library

Download from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ATRC)

The ATRC native C DLLs need to be copied into the same directory as the executable or added to path for this C# wrapper to work.

All of the C DLLs (ATRC-Win32.dll, ATRC-x64.dll, ATRC-x64.so) can be all copied there, since the library automatically resolves which one to use

Downloads these prebuilt binaries from ATRC's [release page](https://github.com/Antonako1/ATRC/releases). Please check that the version numbers match your current nuget package version

## Docs
ATRC automatically compiles C# docs and should be seen in your IDE automatically when inspecting functions

ATRC Official documentation can be found on the project's github page at [https://github.com/Antonako1/ATRC/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/Antonako1/ATRC/tree/main/docs)
